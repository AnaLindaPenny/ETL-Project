q_why_do_you_include_deaths_where_the_tesla_was_not_at_fault
"A: NHTSA death statistics cited by Elon Musk do not differentiate between at-fault and not-at-fault. All manufacturers are treated the same way. For the purposes of calculating Tesla fatalities in accordance with NHTSA methodology, I also do not include the many deaths"
"in other vehicles, despite Teslas being at fault in the majority of those cases."
"Q: Why do you include deaths in other vehicles, as well as pedestrian and cyclist deaths?"
A: There is also a column that shows only driver deaths
Q: Your data captures all driving miles. But AutoPilot is safer
"A: See the Jalopnik article on the 'Resources' tab, which discusses the NHTSA coverup of AutoPilot data"
Q: You are just counting deaths in news articles. You can't base any conclusions on that
A: Deaths reported in news articles are a lower bound on Tesla deaths
Q: Tesla only has 3x the driver deaths of luxury vehicles because you're comparing Tesla to Lamborghinis and Bugattis that are seldom driven
"A: No. The 'Medium' article on the 'Resources' tab compares Teslas to BMW, Lexus, and Mercedes"
Q: You include a death where a piece of concrete fell on a Tesla. That's absurd!
"A: See the first question above. Auto fatality statistics include *all* deaths, no matter how absurd. So to compare Tesla to other vehicles, we need to include all deaths."
